Animate Your Name - FAQ staging area
===========

## The Plan
This is the current Plan. Plans change. Changes will be reflected here.

Create four documents, one for each of the following categories.


## General Questions
1. Did we really learn anything?
  - a) you have learned basic principles of coding
  - b) using external resources is normal practice in professional coding
[as a example we can give jQuery]
  - c) beauty of customization
2. Where is all the code that is making this happen?
  - a) few lines about 'how to use external scripts' and `<script>` tag
  - b) list of used resources
3. I want to learn how this really works.
  - a) go to the **Behind the Scenes** section of FAQ :)

## Behind the Scenes
1. How does alphabet.js work?
[I think that my answer to this questions was pretty complex, any ideas what can we add?]
2. How does bounceBubbles() know what to do?
3. What does drawName() really do?

## Outside Implementation
1. How can I make bouncing bubbles work away from Codecademy?
2. Bouncing bubbles does not work from my hard drive [offline]
3. Can I have more than one line of text?
[I do not know if it should be here or in customization, but this is more about implementing, not changing script]

## Customization
1. How can I make more colours?
2. Can I have more shapes?
[I will prepare example with triangles, we will link course about drawing with JavaScript]
3. Can I change the font size?
4. Can I change size of the dots?
5. How to add color fading?
