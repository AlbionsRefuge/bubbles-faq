### Did we really learn anything?

Hopefully you did!  

This project is aimed at new JavaScript coders. The goal is to give you a feel for the language and have you end up with something fun at the end, fun enough that you will be interested in learning more. 

#### You have learned several basic principles of coding in this short project

You've learned that:

- data can be a **string**, like your name, or a collection of items, like the color **arrays**. 
- you can give your data a name so that it will be easier for you to work with.
- you can write code to find the **length** of a string, to do **math** and to **compare** two things
- there are reusable blocks of code called **functions** that do what they are meant to whenever you call them
- you can use **if/else** statements to change what happens in your program

That is quite a lot!
 
#### Using external resources is normal practice in professional coding 

You may have noticed that your final result was doing a lot more than you probably expected. 

There isn't much sense re-inventing the wheel. The same goes for coding tasks. There are [many  libraries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries) of JavaScript code that will make life easier for you. You will see a link to the popular [jQuery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) library in your `index.html` tab.

#### Beauty of customization

You will have learned a little bit about customization too. Remember how easy it was to change the look of your bubbles just by picking different color and shape names? You can always make improvements to your base code. You can dig into scripts and change single values, like the size of the dots. Read more on that in the [Customization](https://github.com/AlbionsRefuge/bubbles-faq/blob/master/customization.md) section.

### Where is all the code that is making this happen?

Check your `index.html` tab, you will see links there that pull in additional code from other places. Notice how there are several `<script>` tags. Those tags are what you use to gain access to other scripts that are external to your code.

You should see links to three external files plus your own main.js file.

- main.js
- code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
- http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/alphabet.js
- http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/bubbles.js

If you'd like to see what those files contain, take the URL and go to it with your browser, it will display as plain text. You might think that the alphabet.js file is a bit messy and hard to read. To see the code in an easier to read format, copy all of the code and paste it into a code beautifying tool like http://jsbeautifier.org/

### I want to learn how this really works.

Good!  Go to the [Behind the Scenes](https://github.com/AlbionsRefuge/bubbles-faq/blob/master/behind the scenes.md)  section of these FAQ posts :)
